Allow Multisite iFrames and embeds plugin, allows inserting embeds and iframes on a multisite wp install.

== Description ==
The WP Multisite concept, usually refers to a network of blogs like WordPress.com, where a large number of blogs may be installed, and not all the users of those blogs are verified trusted users of the network.
With networks like that, security issues may arise, and automattic has taken the decission to protect the software from those issues.

But a second application of the multisite concept would consist of a (may be) a smaller and controlled network of sites. An example of that would be a multisite corporate web page used for hosting different translations of the same website. In that case, the security issues mentioned do not apply, since all the users of that network are known and trusted users. In this case, it's interesting to change the behaviour of the WordPress estandard multisite installation.

This is precisely what **'Allow Multisite iFrames and embeds'** plugin does, allows all users with rights to create content, to embed iFrames and embeded html objects. A nice application of that is being able to insert Youtube videos, for instance.

== Installation ==
1. Upload "allow-multisite-iframes-embeds" folder to the "/wp-content/plugins/" directory.
2. Network activate the plugin from the network pugin administration dashboard.
